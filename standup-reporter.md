# Standup Reporter Role

You are generating the **daily engineering standup report** for EvenPlay/SMG.

Invoke this role each morning with: `Use the standup-reporter role`

---

## Configuration

- **JIRA:** smgames.atlassian.net, projects: SMG, BO, KIOS
- **JIRA credentials:** `~/.config/jira/credentials` (email: andrew@evenplay.com)
- **GitHub repos:** `EvenPlay/evenplay-mono`, `EvenPlay/ep2.0`
- **Team roster:**
  - Andrew Costello → `andrewcostello`
  - Boris → `borisevenplay`
  - Justin Scott → `justin-workeven`
  - Suren Martirosyan → `surenevenplay`
  - Taleh Ibrahimli → `tislib`
  - Nafeem Haque → `nafeemhaque`
  - Eashan → (JIRA only — no GitHub login confirmed)
  - Fahim → (GitHub login TBC)
  - Roman Gonzales-Valdes → `roman-2kgroup` (external contractor)

## Blocker Label System (managed in JIRA)

Tickets carry one of three impact labels that drive Priority Watch sorting and the Next Up section:

| Label | Meaning | Display |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `ep-blocker` | Active blocker — blocking work right now | 🚨 Blocker |
| `ep-soon` | Will be a blocker within days | ⏰ Soon |
| `ep-future` | Will block when we shift to new backoffice | 🔜 On launch |

A ticket can have `ep-watch` without an impact label — it's watched but not urgent.

---

## Step 1 — Determine report window

- Report date = yesterday (last Friday if today is Monday)
- Week window = Monday through today
- Use `date` command to calculate. Store as `REPORT_DATE` (YYYY-MM-DD) and `MONDAY_DATE`.

---

## Step 2 — Collect Watch List data

Fetch all `ep-watch` / `ep-blocker` / `ep-soon` / `ep-future` tickets:

```bash
curl -s "https://smgames.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/search/jql" \
  -u "${EMAIL}:${TOKEN}" \
  -G \
  --data-urlencode 'jql=labels in ("ep-watch","ep-blocker","ep-soon","ep-future") ORDER BY priority DESC, updated ASC' \
  --data-urlencode 'fields=key,summary,status,assignee,priority,created,updated,parent,comment,issuelinks,labels' \
  --data-urlencode 'maxResults=100'
```

For each ticket extract:
- `key`, `summary`, `status.name`, `assignee.displayName` (or "⬛ Unassigned")
- `created` → age in days; `updated` → days since last update
- `labels` → look for `ep-blocker`, `ep-soon`, `ep-future` to determine impact tier
- `parent.key + parent.fields.summary` (epic/parent, or "—")
- Latest comment body excerpt (first 80 chars)
- Linked issues where inward type contains "block" and linked issue status != Done → these are blockers **of** this ticket

Sort the watch list: `ep-blocker` first → `ep-soon` → `ep-future` → unlabelled, then by priority within each group.

---

## Step 3 — Collect standard JIRA data

### Workflow state mapping
The report uses new state labels regardless of current JIRA status names.
Map as follows when displaying states in the report:

| JIRA Status (current) | Display as | Icon |
|-----------------------|-----------|------|
| To Do | To Do | — |
| In Development | 🔨 In Development | 🔨 |
| Is Blocked | ⏳ Waiting | ⏳ |
| In Dev QA | 📦 Development Complete | 📦 |
| In Internal QA | 🧪 In QA | 🧪 |
| Done | ✅ Done | ✅ |
| Canceled | Canceled | — |

All other legacy statuses (`Awaiting Internal Deployment`, `Awaiting External Deployment`, `On Hold`, `In UAT`, `Prod Test`, `In Progress`, etc.) display as-is until migrated.

```bash
# Completed yesterday (projection tool "done" = Development Complete OR Done)
jql: project in (SMG,BO,KIOS) AND status changed to "Done" ON "REPORT_DATE"
jql: project in (SMG,BO,KIOS) AND status changed to "In Dev QA" ON "REPORT_DATE"

# All active tickets
jql: project in (SMG,BO,KIOS) AND status in ("In Development","Is Blocked","In Dev QA","In Internal QA") ORDER BY updated DESC

# P0 security tickets
jql: issueKey in (SMG-1652,SMG-1653,SMG-1654,SMG-1655,SMG-1657,SMG-1659,SMG-1660)

# Each person's open assigned tickets (for Up Next)
jql: project in (SMG,BO,KIOS) AND assignee = "{person}" AND status not in ("Done","Canceled") ORDER BY priority DESC, updated ASC
```

---

## Step 4 — Collect GitHub data

```bash
YESTERDAY=$(date -v-1d +%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00Z 2>/dev/null || date -d "yesterday" +%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00Z)
MONDAY=$(date -v-monday +%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00Z 2>/dev/null || date -d "last monday" +%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00Z)

# Yesterday's commits — both repos
gh api "repos/EvenPlay/evenplay-mono/commits?since=${YESTERDAY}&per_page=100" \
  --jq '.[] | {sha: .sha[0:8], author: .commit.author.name, email: .commit.author.email, message: (.commit.message | split("\n")[0])}'
gh api "repos/EvenPlay/ep2.0/commits?since=${YESTERDAY}&per_page=100" \
  --jq '.[] | {sha: .sha[0:8], author: .commit.author.name, email: .commit.author.email, message: (.commit.message | split("\n")[0])}'

# All open PRs with reviewer details
gh pr list --repo EvenPlay/evenplay-mono --state open \
  --json number,title,author,createdAt,updatedAt,headRefName,reviewDecision,reviewRequests,reviews --limit 50

# PRs merged yesterday
gh pr list --repo EvenPlay/evenplay-mono --state merged \
  --json number,title,author,mergedAt,headRefName --limit 30

# This week's commits for leaderboard
gh api "repos/EvenPlay/evenplay-mono/commits?since=${MONDAY}&per_page=100" \
  --jq '.[] | {author: .commit.author.email, message: (.commit.message | split("\n")[0])}'
```

---

## Step 5 — Analysis rules

**Stale PR:** 🟡 3–6 days · 🔴 7–13 days · 🚨 14d+
**No activity:** zero commits + zero JIRA transitions + zero PR events yesterday
**Work without ticket:** commit >5 lines with no `SMG-\d+`, `BO-\d+`, or `KIOS-\d+` reference

**Exclusions — never flag as "work without ticket":**
- Justin Scott's commits to `ep2.0` — AI experimentation tracked separately

**Ticket stall thresholds by state:**
| Display State | JIRA Status | Stall Threshold | Flag |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|------|
| 🔨 In Development | In Development | 7d no update | ⚠️ |
| ⏳ Waiting | Is Blocked | 3d no update | ⚠️ blocker not resolving |
| 📦 Development Complete | In Dev QA | 3d no update | ⚠️ QA deploy not happening |
| 🧪 In QA | In Internal QA | 5d no update | ⚠️ QA not moving |
| To Do | To Do | 7d no assignee + no comment | needs-decision flag |

**Watch list stall:**
- 🟢 Active: updated ≤2d
- 🟡 Slowing: 3–5d
- 🔴 Stalled: 6d+
- ⬛ No assignee: flag immediately regardless of stall

**⏳ Waiting — distinguish context by prior state:**
- Came from 🔨 In Development → dev is blocked mid-build. Show what/who it's waiting on.
- Came from 🧪 In QA → QA rejected. Needs a dev to pick it back up. Flag assignee.

**Per-person Team Status logic:**
- 🔄 **Now** = tickets in 🔨 In Development, ⏳ Waiting, 📦 Development Complete, or 🧪 In QA assigned to this person
- ➡️ **Next** = single highest-priority action:
  1. PR with CHANGES_REQUESTED → address review before any ticket
  2. Their `ep-blocker` tickets not yet started
  3. Their `ep-soon` tickets not yet started
  4. Their highest-priority open ticket in current sprint
  5. If 0 open assigned tickets → suggest highest-priority unassigned `ep-watch` ticket
- **Every team member gets a row.** All three columns empty → `⚠️ No active work, nothing completed — status unknown`

**Needs-decision flag:** Ticket in To Do 7+ days, no assignee, no recent comment → stalled on ownership not execution.

---

## Step 6 — Pre-publish flag check (terminal only — not published)

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔔 PRE-STANDUP FLAGS — For Andrew Only
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️  CONCERNS
- Any ep-watch ticket with no assignee
- Any ep-blocker ticket stalled 3+ days
- ep-soon tickets approaching blocker status (5+ days without movement)
- P0 security ticket with no movement 7+ days
- PR APPROVED but not merged (especially if ticket is Done)
- Team member 3+ consecutive days no activity
- PR 14d+ open
- Ticket status suggests Done but not closed in JIRA

💬  TALKING POINTS FOR THIS MORNING
1. [most urgent — usually an active blocker or unreviewed P0 PR]
2. [second]
3. [third]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## Step 7 — Format the report

**Confluence page title:** `YYYY-MM-DD - DayOfWeek - Standup` (e.g. `2026-03-13 - Friday - Standup`)

Save markdown to `output/standup/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. After saving, run:
```bash
bash docs/standup/publish_standup.sh
```

---

## Weekly Project Health Report

Run on Fridays (or when asked). Covers Mon–Fri of the current week.

### When to generate

- Every Friday after the standup report
- Or any time Andrew asks for the project health report

### Step W1 — Collect project health data

Run `forecast sync` first, then fetch current status for all 7 tracked epics:

```bash
~/Project/forecast/forecast sync

# For each epic, fetch children with status breakdown
# Epics: SMG-2101, SMG-2063, SMG-1745, SMG-1948, SMG-1662, SMG-2182, SMG-2183
curl -s "https://smgames.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/search/jql" \
  -u "${EMAIL}:${TOKEN}" \
  -G \
  --data-urlencode "jql=parent = {EPIC}" \
  --data-urlencode 'fields=key,summary,status,assignee,priority,updated' \
  --data-urlencode 'maxResults=200'

# Tickets completed this week
jql: project in (SMG,BO,KIOS) AND status changed to Done AFTER "{MONDAY_DATE}"
```

For each epic compute: `TOTAL`, `DONE`, `ACTIVE` (In Dev / In PR / In Dev QA / Awaiting Deploy / Is Blocked), `TODO`, `UNASSIGNED_OPEN`, `STALLED_ACTIVE` (14d+ with no update).

Also run `forecast report` for the three main projects:
```bash
~/Project/forecast/forecast report --project tech-debt
~/Project/forecast/forecast report --project backoffice
~/Project/forecast/forecast report --project infrastructure
```

### Step W2 — Compare to prior week

Read the previous weekly report from `output/weekly/` to extract prior Done counts per epic. Compute the week-over-week change (tickets completed, % point movement).

### Step W3 — Save and publish

**Filename:** `output/weekly/YYYY-WNN.md` (ISO week number, e.g. `2026-W11.md`)

After saving, publish to Confluence:

```python
import json, requests, subprocess

BASE = "https://smgames.atlassian.net/wiki"
AUTH = ("andrew@evenplay.com", JIRA_TOKEN)
SPACE = "Documentat"
HEADERS = {"Content-Type": "application/json", "Accept": "application/json"}

# Find or create "Engineering Weekly Reports" parent page (id: 334200836)
r = requests.get(f"{BASE}/rest/api/content", auth=AUTH, headers=HEADERS,
                 params={"spaceKey": SPACE, "title": "Engineering Weekly Reports", "type": "page"})
results = r.json().get("results", [])
root_id = results[0]["id"] if results else None  # create if missing (see standup publish script pattern)

# Convert markdown to Confluence storage HTML
html_body = subprocess.run(
    ["pandoc", INPUT_FILE, "-t", "html", "--no-highlight"],
    capture_output=True, text=True).stdout

# Page title format: "YYYY-WNN - Week NN - Project Health"
title = f"{WEEK_KEY} - Week {WEEK_NUM} - Project Health"

# Create or update page under Engineering Weekly Reports
# (use same create/update pattern as publish_standup.sh)
```

**Confluence hierarchy:**
```
Documentation space
└── Engineering Weekly Reports          (id: 334200836)
    └── YYYY-WNN - Week NN - Project Health
```

[Use forecast tool output where available. Flag "Unknown" when no completions yet.]

---

*Week {NN} · Mon {Date} – Fri {Date} · Auto-generated from GitHub and JIRA*
```

### Analysis rules for weekly reports

- **Material movement:** ≥5 tickets completed OR ≥5pp change in % done
- **Stalled project:** 0 completions for 2+ consecutive weeks → flag explicitly
- **Staffing problem vs velocity problem:** If `UNASSIGNED_OPEN > 50%` of open tickets, the issue is ownership not execution — say so
- **Forecast sync note:** Always run `forecast sync` before pulling report data; note if forecast tool counts differ from JIRA raw counts (usually a label coverage issue)
- **Epic scope changes:** If parent epics were reassigned during the week, note the scope change in the Project Health Tracker section so the % movement is interpretable

## Notes

- Pre-publish flags (Step 6) are terminal only — not saved to the report file or Confluence
- `ep-watch` is required to appear in Priority Watch; impact labels are optional but recommended
- Justin Scott's ep2.0 commits are AI experimentation — never flag as work without tickets
- Confluence page title must be `YYYY-MM-DD - DayOfWeek - Standup` for correct sidebar ordering
